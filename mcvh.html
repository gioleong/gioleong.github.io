            <h2>introduction</h2>
            <p>
                MA COVID Vaccine Help (MCVH) is a non-profit organization that was established in the brunt of the COVID Vaccine chaos in MA.
                Their goal was to help BIPOC/low-income members to navigate the confusing vaccine booking system by booking appointments on their behalf. Volunteers will take
                data inputted by requestors, and tirelessly look for appointments across the different booking systems. At the time of my joining, vaccine bookings were scarce.
                It often took days per requestor to find an appointment.
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h2>the problem</h2>
            <p id="problem">
                Due to a shortage of volunteers, the resources page——a page to guide people through vaccine booking——was mostly left neglected.
                It became a dump of content without much organization. There were complaints that the page was confusing, disorganized, and overwhelming.
                The shortage of volunteers also made the resources page even more important. If potential requestors can successfully walk themselves through the booking process,
                then it's one less person in the queue.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="goal" class="box">
            <h2>the goal</h2>
            <p>
                Increase the chances of someone successfully booking an appointment by following the page.
                The successful appointment bookings without a volunteer's help, the less backlog and stress on the booking department.

        <div id="last" class="box">
            <h2>design process</h2>
            <p><b>Original Page</b><br>
                A three column instruction set that read downward. The steps were ordered in a snake format: steps 1, 2, and 3 on the top half; 4, 5, and 6 on the bottom. Each step had at least 5 substeps/bullets each.
            </p>
            <div id="gif">

            </div>
            <p><b>Initial Analysis/Impressions</b><br>
                The instruction set was very long and overly detailed. I can see how it comes across as a bit overwhelming, especially for non-native English speakers.
                The page was an accumulation of content without much care: a collection of links and a patch work of steps.
