        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
            MA COVID Vaccination Help (MCVH) is a non-profit organization that was established in the brunt of the COVID Vaccine chaos in MA.
            Their goal was to help BIPOC/low-income members to navigate the confusing vaccine booking system by booking appointments on their behalf. Volunteers will take
            data inputted by requestors, and tirelessly look for appointments across the different booking systems. At the time of my joining, vaccine bookings were scarce.
            It often took days per requestor to find an appointment.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h2>the problem</h2>
        <p id="problem">
            Due to a shortage of volunteers, the resources page&mdash;a page to guide people through vaccine booking&mdash;was mostly left neglected.
            It became a dump of content without much organization. There were complaints that the page was confusing, disorganized, and overwhelming.
            The shortage of volunteers also made the resources page even more important. If potential requestors can successfully walk themselves through the booking process,
            then it's one less person in the queue.
        </p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p id="role">
            <span>UX Designer</span>
            I worked with three other UX volunteers and coordinated with the head organizers of the non-profit to turn their ideas into reality.
            I was in charge of wireframing the redesign, collaborating with the language team, and improving the instruction set.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="goal" class="box">
        <h2>the goal</h2>
        <p>
            How can we increase the chances of someone successfully booking an appointment by following the page?
            The more successful appointment bookings without a volunteer's help, the less backlog, and stress on the booking department.
        </p>

    <div class="box">
        <h2>design process</h2>
        <p><span class="subheader">Original Page</span>
            A three-column instruction set that read downward. The steps were ordered in a snake format: steps 1, 2, and 3 on the top half; 4, 5, and 6 on the bottom. Each step had at least 5 substeps/bullets each.
        </p>
        <div id="gif">
            <img src="imgs/resources_orig.gif">
        </div>
        <p><span class="subheader">Initial Analysis/Impressions</span>
            I went through the instructions step-by-step pretending to be an end-user. I got lost in the wordy explanations and long substeps. Some parts were optional that also caused slight confusion. <br><br>
            Initial takeaway: great information, confusing instructions.
        </p>
        <p><span class="subheader">Research</span>
            Takeaways from the conversation with MCVH head organizer:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li> Wanted to simplify the page, but requested for the page to remain largely similar </li>
            <li> Noted positive feedback returning from requestor about the page's information </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Takeaways from the conversation with other volunteers</p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li> Information helpful, but shouldn't deter people away. Instructions confusing at times.</li>
            <li> Keep it simple. Many people booking vaccines are elderly who may not be tech-savvy</li>
        </ul>
        Insight: the page needs simplification without compromising the informative nature of the content because people are finding information on current iteration helpful albeit disorganized.
        <p><span class="subheader">How do we increase clarity without over-simplification?</span>
            Option 1: hide everything in an accordion. Each step has an expandable section when clicked on. <br>
            Option 2: change the instruction wording, keep everything the same <br>
            Option 3: change the instruction wording. Reduce the three columns into one column so the instructions read from top to down/left to right.
        </p>
        <p><span class="subheader">How do we increase the success rate of self-guided bookings?</span>
            The instruction set needs to strike the perfect balance of being thorough but also easy to understand:
        </p>
        <ul class ="list">
            <li> The instructions need to be concise, there's a bit too much "fluff" with the original set. Often, the main point of the step is lost. Each step should only achieve one thing at a time.</li>
            <li> Keep language at a grade level.</li>
            <li> Steps in the original instructions walked people through using Twitter bots, auto-fill extensions, or auto-refresh tools. These steps are beyond the capabilities of many.
                The page is for a general audience, which includes many elderly members of the community. The technicality of these steps can easily confuse people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The page needs to match the mental models of what an instruction set should be:</p>
        <ul class ="list">
            <li>It should read from top to down, left to right. Most importantly, one step after another.</li>
            <li>Keep scrolling to a minimum for continuity reasons. A three-column layout requires the user to scroll up and down&mdash;an invitation for errors.</li>
        </ul>
         <div id="gif">
            Wireframe (desktop + mobile):
            <img src="imgs/mockup.png">
        </div>
        <p id="final" class="subheader"> Ultimately, the option that checks off the most boxes is option 3. It tackles the root of the issue by simplifying the page. Not only are the instructions more readable and less verbose, the prototype illustrates how the redesign flows like a logical document with the steps sequentially organized. However, the page reamins largely familiar.</p>
        <div id="gif">
            <img src="imgs/final.gif">
        </div>
            <p><span class="subheader">No accordion?</span>
                Choosing the accordion layout makes sense when the order of the content doesn't matter. However, it matters in our case, so we do not want to encourage people to jump in at random steps. It may look nice, but it doesn't achieve our goal. A user jumping in at step 5 could significantly diminish their success rate because the steps are interconnected.
                Putting everything into expandable trays keeps things compact, but some people may not even know to click. For more about accordion layouts, I suggest checking out this great <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordions-complex-content/">case study</a> by NN/g.
