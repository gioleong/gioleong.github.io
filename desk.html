        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The following project was completed at during my junior year at Tufts.
            It was a product design project that involved designing a piece of furniture or item for teens. I chose design a desk converter, a device that can be placed on a sitting desk to convert it into a standing one.
            More details on my choice a bit later. The project took about a month (early november to mid-decemeber).
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h2>the problem</h2>
        <p>
            I was tasked with designing a piece of furniture for teens, specially 16 to 19 years old. I was given the liberty to pick any type of furniture, so I chose the desk converter to tackle the issue of prolonged sitting.
            Prolonged sitting can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and blood clots. As teens begin to negotiate greater academic and social obligations, the time they spend at a desk naturally increases.
            There's no better time to foster healthy desk use habits. A desk converter with an companion app—to keep up with the times—can empower teens to make the right choice for their bodies
            when they use their desk. The problem is that existing desk converters are designed for adults to use in their office spaces and not for teens.

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
            <span>Product Designer, UX Researcher, UX Designer</span>
            I worked alone on this project. The project involved the whole design process starting from a seed of an idea to a final product prototype for the desk converter
            on Solidworks and a high fidelity prototype for the companion app on Figma. A conducted user research with my target demographic to inform the whole design process.

        <h2>the Goal</h2>
        <p>
            How can I design a desk converter with a accompanying app to tailor to the physical traits and needs of a teen?
            The goal is to design a desk converter that considers teens in the design process unlike those that can be found on online marketplaces.

        <p class="subheader"> Needfinding </p>
        <p>
            <u> Survey: </u> <br>
            I knew that I had to design a desk converter and an app, but the question is "how?".
            To answer the question, I began conducting user research to get a better understanding of my target demographic. I sent a survey out to a group of 16 to 19-year-olds and received 20 responses.
        </p>
        <p>Survey highlights/lowlights:</p>
        <ul class ="list">
            <li>Average 7 hours spent at their desk per day</li>
            <li>75% of the respondents did not take breaks to segment periods at their desk that lasted longer than two hours</li>
            <li>80% of respondents wanted to switch positions but couldn't</li>
            <li>Laptop, phone, and notebook were the three most commonly used items at desks as reported by the teens</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Takeaways: <br>
            The survey revealed that reducing prolonged sitting is an afterthought for many teens caused by a lack of access to other options or knowledge of the dangers.
            Teens in the survey did not take breaks to split long periods of sitting, and did not actively log their desk use patterns.
            As a result, what we see is long hours of prolonged sitting: 7 hours per day on average. However, the silver lining is that the respondents showed a general
            interest in varying their positions between sitting and standing. They were no stranger to elevated desk solutions like monitor arms, laptop stands, and thick books.
            The survey also revealed that teens often use their laptops, phones, and notebooks at their desks.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u>Task Analysis: </u><br>
            To supplement the survey findings, I conducted a task analysis. I had a 17-year-old walk me through how they would typically use their desk daily.
            Their words were turned into a flow chart to help me spot trends and opportunities.
        </p>
        <div class="gif">
            <img id="task" src="imgs/task_analysis.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            The task analysis helped identify design opportunities and corroborated many of the survey findings. It confirmed the finding that laptops, phones, and notebooks were commonly
            used at a desk by teens; it revealed that a desk converter and app has the potential to be helpful in the auxiliary loop to improve desk use habits.
        </p>
        <p class="subheader"> Design </p>
        <p>
            <u>Designing the desk converter: </u><br>
            There are two main design options for a desk converter. The most common one is the scissor hinge design; however, the design is quite bulky and adds extra height to the user's existing desk.
            Since teens may not have the flexibilty to make drastic changes to their setup, the desk converter must not add extra height to the desk in sitting mode. Thus, I opted for the
            vertical arm design with a slidable platform. <br><br>
            To properly consider teens in the design process, a bit of anthropometric research was needed. Since the desk converter will be resting on a user's desk, the average height of a table was
            was key to the anthropometric decisions I made. According to market research on Amazon, the average height of a desk is 30"/76cm. Using the Consumer Product Safety Commission's anthropometric
            as a guide, the I chose height adjustments for the platform of 5cm increments from 40cm to 65cm. This should comfortably accommodate the extremes of my target demographic: 5th percentile 16-year-old up to 95th percentile
            19-year-old.

            The platform dimensions were influenced by the survey findings. Since a laptop, phone, and/or notebook are most likely to be used at a desk, the dimension I chose must fit those items.
            I settled on 40cm by 80cm, which should comfortably fit a 16" Macbook Pro and a notebook side-by-side. If the desk can fit a popular large laptop, it can definitely fit smaller ones.

        <p>
            <u>Designing the companion app: </u><br>
            Designing the app was an iterative process. The design process was broken down into three phases: low fidelity prototype, user testing, and high fidelity prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
            Low Fidelity Prototype: <br>
            The low fidelity prototype was designed to address the issues exposed by the survey. The low fidelity prototype has 3 major features:
        </p>
        <ol class ="list">
            <li>Since teens in the survey were unlikely to log their hours at their desk, the app automatically tracks desk use statistics and displays them on the homepage. </li>
            <li>A timer button to encourage teens to set break reminders and combat the trend found in the survey</li>
            <li>An instruction set to help safely adjust their desk converter </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="gif">
            <img src="imgs/lofi_desk.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            The goal of the low fidelity prototype was to empower teens with information and options so they are aware of their use patterns to better
            inform health conscious decisions. The prototype was put through a round of user testing.
        </p>
        <p>User testing takeaways: </p>
        <ul class ="list">
            <li>Users wanted more stats on the homepage </li>
            <li>Instruction headers were confusing</li>
            <li>Can't check timer status outside of timer screen</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            High fidelity prototype: <br>
            I designed the prototype to address many of the issues uncovered from user testing. Beyond the added detail, the homepage received the most changes.
            An extra card was added to the statistic carousel in response to the test results. Users can now see the hours at their desk daily, hours at their desk weekly, and hours spent taking breaks.
        </p>
        <div class="gif">
            <img src="imgs/stats.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            The chart was made interactive so users can click on the bars for a more detailed breakdown. The chart deliberately mimics a commonly used design pattern to display screen time on devices that run iOS or Android.
            The familiarity of the design should hopefully boost usability. Lastly, the timer button was given 3 different states. Instead of a static button, the button now changes depending on whether a timer is active or not.
            If a timer is active, the button will display the remaining time; if not, it'll be blank (see below).
        </p>
        <div class="gif">
            <img src="imgs/timer.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            The vague instruction headers were rephrased to be more specific and actionable. For example, "slide platform" was replaced with "raise or lower platform". "Slide" was too
            vague and it can mean any direction, "raise or lower" is a lot clearer. Users should be able to clearly understand the action they need to take just by reading the header.
            Even if they fail to read the description, it shouldn't lead to catastrophe. The instruction screen borrows a few commonly used design patterns. Users swipe back and forth
            to navigate the instructions. Their location in the instructions is indicated by the classic dot indicators and users always can exit the instruction set at whatever step
            they are on.

        <p>
            <u>Next steps:  </u><br>
            More user testing can be conducted to help spot more usability issues that could've been introduced during the design of the high fidelity prototype. During user testing, one user spoke about how they are
            unlikely to use the timer feature if the app isn't already opened. Making the app more enticing—potentially through gamification—is something worth exploring. More of the development went into the app, and less into the physical
            desk converter. The next stage in development is to turn the CAD drawing of the desk converter into a physical prototype. This should help spot issues with the desk converter's design.
