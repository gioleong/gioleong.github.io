        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The following project was completed during my junior year at Tufts.
            It was a human-computer interaction (HCI) group project that took about four months.
            During the four months, we turned our frustration for bad movie recommendations on streaming platforms into a computer application: Popcorn.
            The design process was guided by an iterative process that involved user research, user testing, and prototyping. The project concluded with a completed high-fidelity prototype.
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h2>the problem</h2>
        <p>
            Automatically generated movie recommendations on streaming platforms suck.
            They are rarely ever accurate because algorithms never truly understand the user as a whole.
            We discovered through interviews that the best recommenders are their friends and family, yet
            they can be inaccessible at times. Sadly, people resort to using the bad recommendations because it's the next best alternative.
            As it stands, there's a gap between the solitary and community aspect of media consumption. People want to connect with their social circles
            for recommendations, but actively starting or engaging in conversation can be difficult for various reasons.

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
            <span>UX Researcher, UX/UI Designer</span> <br>
            I took on more of a leadership role for the project by coordinating responsibilities to ensure the project is on track.
            I also contributed to user research and prototyping on Figma.

        <h2>the Goal</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of the project is to address the frustrations of finding new media to watch. After user research, the project was guided by these 3 main questions: <br>
        </p>
            <ol class ="list">
                <li> How might we allow people to watch media “together” without both necessarily being present or spoiling it for other people, so media continues to feel like a connection for people with differing schedules? </li>
                <li> How might we help people accurately find new media without feeling like they are bothering their friends, or having to scroll through hours of AI generated recommendations? </li>
                <li> How might we enable people to save ideas about media for themselves while also leaving ideas for others? </li>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h2>design process</h2>
        <p class="subheader"> Needfinding </p>
        <p>
            <u> Interviews: </u> <br>
            We had our  frustrations with exploring new movies/TV shows to watch, but that doesn't mean it's the same for others. We interviewed five different people that represent different demographics: a college freshman,
            a college junior, a tech entrepreneur, a working mom of three, and a graduate student.
        </p>
        <p>Interview takeaways:</p>
        <ul class ="list">
            <li>Most argued that automatically/AI generated recommendations on streaming platforms are inaccurate. </li>
            <li>Due to the inaccuracies of AI generated recommendations, they waste time scrolling through long lists. </li>
            <li>Recommendations from friends and family are usually the most accurate. The exchange of recommendations is a rewarding experience. </li>
            <li>Most watched movies/TV shows alone on their own devices</li>
            <li>There's a major community aspect to watching movies/TV shows; it's a great conversation starter and a medium to connect with friends</li>
            <li>
                Reaching out to friends for recommendations can be awkward at times because of differing schedules or fear of
                disturbing them. As a result, the interviewees opted to settle for the AI recommendations even though they are bad.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We found that watching movies/TV shows in the modern age is a quite solitary activity. People are happy with the streaming platforms albeit their inefficiencies.
            However, people warmly welcome input from their friends and are willing to explore what their friends are saying about a movie/TV show. After synthesizing the interview notes, we concluded that consuming media can be a solitary activity
            but there’s a major community aspect that may be inaccessible at times.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u> Solution Brainstorm: </u> <br>
            The solution brainstorm was guided by a set of forty "how might we?" questions. After discussion we chose the three best, and brainstormed corresponding solutions in response to the "how might we?" questions.
        </p>
        <div class="gif">
            <img src="imgs/brainstorm.png">
        </div>

        <p>
            After a bit of testing, we chose to pursue a "platform to connect with friends over media through clips, timestamped comments, friend recommendations lists, and ratings" as our solution.
            This solution addreses the interview findings by giving people a passive platform to quickly connect with friends and see what their friends are up to in the media consumption world. There is no need to actively engage in any form of
            live conversation, so differing schedules or geographical constraints don't matter.
        </p>

        <p class="subheader"> Design </p>
        <p>
            <u>Paper Prototypes: </u><br>
            The design process was kickstarted with paper prototypes. I am a huge proponent of paper prototypes because they can help identify issues early on in the process.
            Spotting problems now is a lot less expensive than finding them later on in the process when large investments of time have already been made. Prototypes are quick to draw and can save a lot of time later down the road.
            The idea of our app—Popcorn—is a social media experience that revolves around media consumption. We took advantage of existing design patterns to boost familiarity and usability (not reinventing the wheel) while adding our
            flair to suit our goal.
        </p>
        <div class="gif">
            <img src="imgs/paper.png">
        </div>
        <div class="gif">
            <img src="imgs/paper2.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            The paper prototypes were put through a round of testing. The testing helped us discover three major issues:
        </p>
        <ol class ="list">
            <li>The trending now tab on the homepage was confusing. Does it mean trending worldwide or trending among friends?</li>
            <li>Users never visited their friends' profile pages</li>
            <li>Users expected the conventional social media like, comment, share buttons. Those buttons were missing from our paper prototype. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <u> Low Fidelity Prototype: </u> <br>
            Given my experience in Figma, I led most of the digital prototyping.
            The paper prototypes were digitized on Figma to form low fidelity prototypes;
            the low fidelity prototypes addressed the issues uncovered by the paper prototype testing.
            The trending now header was replaced with popular among friends. Clickable items on posts,
            such as the user name, were underlined and boldened to emphasize clickability. We hoped that
            by making clickable items more obvious users would be more likely to visit the pages that were
            missed in the paper prototypes. The conventional social media buttons were added to every
            post to meet user expectations. There were other minor changes throughout the prototype in response to the
            comments, expressions, and behaviors expressed by our paper prototype testers.
        </p>
        <div class="gif">
            <img src="imgs/popcorn_lofi.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            The low-fidelity prototypes were put through a series of tests to check for usability issues.
            Users were able to navigate through the low fidelity prototype quite smoothly because of the familiarity with our design.
            However, there were still issues throughout the prototype.
        </p>
        <ol class ="list">
            <li>
                Creating a post was confusing. There was an unnecessary "+" button that the user had to press to
                reveal the option to post whatever they wrote. Users expected that the plus button will
                immediately publish whatever they have written in the textbook.
                <div class="gif">
                    <img src="imgs/post.png">
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                Users had no user control and freedom. A user making edits to their profile page cannot
                cancel their edits. They are stuck with whatever edits they have made to their profile when they press
                the edit button. This design flow is unforgiving, especially for users who might've
                accidentally pressed the button.
            </li>
            <li>Users couldn't exit the search bar</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <u> High Fidelity Prototype: </u> <br>
            The high fidelity prototype addresses the usability problems identified in the previous stages of
            development and introduces detail in place of the placeholder boxes. Popcorn is ultimately a social
            media platform that revolves around media consumption. Users can freely post about movies
            and TV shows for their friends to see and eave recommendations on their profile page for friends
            to access for inspiration. Popcorn fosters a sense of community without compromising the solitary
            aspect of watching a movie or a TV show. Friends and family may still passively connect over Popcorn
            to explore media. There is no need to scroll bad AI recommendations or bother a busy friend—good,
            accurate recommendations are available 24-7.

        <p class="subheader"> Next steps: </p>
        <p>

            Testing never stops. Another round of user testing can be conducted on the high-fidelity prototype before shipping it off to a coding team. Then testing can be conducted to see the success of our solution.
            During the early stages of design, we flirted with the idea of a browser plugin. A browser plugin is a good next step for Popcorn.
            It can offer features a computer app cannot and it can be a pocket assistant to augment the movie viewing experience.
